/* 
question arises for the above scenario where .test and .test2
block not coming in one line 
display: inline-block; is the solution for this
other solution and better solution is to use flex box

/* inline-block  if :required will take height and width */

/*
   you have to create 3 boxes of equal width
   covering the whole screen
   and they should be next to each other
  
   diagram shown in lecture check at timestamp : 1:50:56 ==> assignment
  
   you can give width in percentage as well the percentage is the screen size 
   of the window
  
   display: none means dont display that element itself
  
   what rem suggest is I am going to take the value of base font size of html 
   by default font size is 16 px 
   so 1 rem  = 16px 
  
   rem is getting derived from the value of the root of the element font size 
  
   rem usage
  -------------
  -  media queries 
  like if we have mobile we can have 
  html{
   font-size : 10px
  }
  
  if its a desktop then we can have 
  html{
    font-size: 20px
  }
  
  at timestamp : 2:14:30 media queries has been discussed copy the code 
  of media query to your system 
  
  
  using media query we can change the div background color to white , black 
  according to the screen size by dragging the size sideways we can get the 
  different color for one div element
